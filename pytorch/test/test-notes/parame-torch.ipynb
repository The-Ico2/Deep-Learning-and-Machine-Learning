    "This code performs an experiment to study the interaction between learning rates and training epochs on finding the minimum of a function using gradient descent. Let's break down how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing Libraries**: The script imports necessary libraries including PyTorch (`torch`), Matplotlib (`plt`), and `time`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Setting Matplotlib Format**: Matplotlib's backend format is set to 'svg'. This setting ensures that Matplotlib plots will be displayed in the Jupyter Notebook using the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Defining Functions**: Several functions are defined:\n",
    "   - `ts(inp)`: Computes the sine of the input.\n",
    "   - `tc(inp)`: Computes the cosine of the input.\n",
    "   - `te(inp)`: Computes the exponential function of the input.\n",
    "   - `tl(inp1, inp2, inp3)`: Generates a tensor containing equally spaced values between `inp1` and `inp2` with `inp3` steps.\n",
    "   - `tr(inp)`: Rounds the input tensor to the nearest integer.\n",
    "   - `tz(inp)`: Generates a tensor of zeros with `inp` elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Main Functionality**:\n",
    "   - A function `fx(x)` is defined, representing a mathematical function.\n",
    "   - A derivative function `deriv(x)` is defined, representing the derivative of the mathematical function.\n",
    "   - The experiment involves varying learning rates and training epochs to find the minimum of the function using gradient descent.\n",
    "   - The script sets up parameters for learning rates and training epochs.\n",
    "   - It initializes a matrix `finalres` to store the results.\n",
    "   - It loops over learning rates and training epochs, performing gradient descent to find the minimum of the function.\n",
    "   - The final guess of the minimum for each combination of learning rate and training epochs is stored in the `finalres` matrix.\n",
    "   - The execution time of the experiment is recorded.\n",
    "   - Finally, the results are plotted using Matplotlib, showing the final guess of the minimum with respect to learning rates and training epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this code demonstrates an experiment to understand how different combinations of learning rates and training epochs affect the convergence of gradient descent in finding the minimum of a function. It's a useful exercise for studying optimization algorithms in machine learning and numerical optimization."
