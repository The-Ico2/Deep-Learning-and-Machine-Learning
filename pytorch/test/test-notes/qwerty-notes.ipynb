    "This code is a Python script that demonstrates training a neural network using PyTorch to classify the Iris dataset into its three species. Let's break down how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Importing Libraries**: The script begins by importing necessary libraries including PyTorch (`torch`), modules from PyTorch's neural network library (`torch.nn`), NumPy (`np`), and Matplotlib (`plt`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Setting Matplotlib Format**: Matplotlib's backend format is set to 'svg'. This setting ensures that Matplotlib plots will be displayed in the Jupyter Notebook using the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Generation**: \n",
    "   - The Iris dataset is loaded using Seaborn's `load_dataset` function. \n",
    "   - The dataset is shuffled (`sample(frac=1)`) to ensure randomness.\n",
    "   - The input features are extracted into a PyTorch tensor named `data`, and labels are converted to numeric values and stored in a tensor named `labels`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Neural Network Definition** (`classANN`):\n",
    "   - This class defines the structure of the neural network.\n",
    "   - It inherits from `torch.nn.Module`.\n",
    "   - The constructor (`__init__`) initializes the layers of the neural network including input, hidden, and output layers. The number of hidden layers and units per layer are parameters passed to the constructor.\n",
    "   - The forward method defines the forward propagation of input through the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Training Function** (`train`):\n",
    "   - This function handles the training process of the neural network.\n",
    "   - It initializes the loss function (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`) and optimizer (`torch.optim.SGD`).\n",
    "   - It runs a loop over a specified number of epochs, performing forward and backward passes, updating model parameters based on computed gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Training Loop**:\n",
    "   - This loop iterates over different configurations of hidden layers and units per layer.\n",
    "   - For each configuration, it creates a new instance of the neural network (`classANN`), trains it, and stores the accuracy achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Plotting**:\n",
    "   - The accuracies achieved for different configurations are plotted against the number of hidden units.\n",
    "   - Each line in the plot corresponds to a different number of hidden layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this script demonstrates how to define a neural network architecture, train it on a dataset, and visualize the training results using Matplotlib. It's a good starting point for understanding how to use PyTorch for neural network training and evaluation."
